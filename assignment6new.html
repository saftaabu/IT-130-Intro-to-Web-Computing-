<p><b>Assignment #6 </b>
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For both pages in this assignment, you will probably find it
useful to create a variable called percentageGrade (for the first
page) and totalCost (for the second). 
</p>
<p>Next, I would suggest reading in all values from the form and
storing them in variables. 
</p>
<p>Then set the value of your grade / cost variable based on the
values you read in from the form. 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Remember to do ONLY ONE SMALL thing at a time. Test it&#226;€&#166;&#226;€&#166;&#160;
Then move on to the next thing. 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><b>Page #1</b></u></p>
<p>Suppose you are responsible for assigning percentage grades for a
course that has 4 homework assignments worth 50 points each, a
midterm out of 100 and a final out of 100.&#160; The percentage score
for the course is calculated as:</p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>Total homework score (a number out of 200) making up 50% of
the course percentage grade.</p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>The midterm makes up 20% of the course percentage grade.</p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>The final make up 30% of the course percentage grade. 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Create a form in which you ask the user to enter their total
homework score, their score on the midterm, and their score on the
final. When they submit the form, indicate to them their percentage
score using&#160; innerHTML.&#160; 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As an example, if they scores 180/200 on their homework, 90/100 on
the midterm and 95/100 on the final, you would calculate their
percentage grade as: 
</p>
<p>(180/200*50) + (90/100*20) + (95/100*30) which comes out to 91.5. 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><b>Page #2</b></u></p>
<p>Modify your pizza ordering form from assignment #5 for this
problem.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>On your pizza ordering page ask the user for the size of pizza
they would like. You may keep the same options as you had for
assignment #5: personal = $6, medium = $9, large = $12.&#160;
However, include an additional option for extra large: $16.&#160;
Also have a select box for number of drinks with options for 0, 1, 2,
3, 4.&#160; Each drink costs $1.&#160; Finally have a select box for
number of desserts, also with options between 0 and 4.&#160; Each
dessert costs $3.&#160; When the user submits their order, output the
total cost of their order as well as all their other information. So
if they ordered a large pizza ($12) plus two drinks (2 * $1 = &#160;$2.00)
plus two desserts (2*$2 = $6.00), you would output their total cost
as being $20. In the output statement, indicate the name, address,
phone and time/date of their order. You may use the &#226;€˜Date()&#226;€™
function to do so.&#160; You may output using&#160; innerHTML. 
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><b>Submission:</b></p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>Don&#226;€™t forget to meet all requirements such as div
sections (have a minimum of 1 per page),&#160; hex codes if using
colors, etc, etc. 
</p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>Also remember that while you must use a parse function
whenever appropriate, you also must NOT use it when it is not needed.
Remember that value that you read in from a from comes in as a
String.&#160; 
</p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>As usual, FTP all files to the server, and include the URLs to
those files as a comment on D2L.
