<p><b>Assignment #4</b></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Remember to be sure and practice the concepts and materials BEFORE
working on the assignment. You will learn and retain the material
<u>much</u> more effectively.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Create a page in which you have 3
buttons. The first button says, &#226;€œPrint Name in &lt;h1&gt;&#226;€<font FACE="SimSun"><span LANG="zh-CN">ﾝ</span></font>,
the second says: &#226;€œPrint Name in &lt;h2&gt;&#226;€<font FACE="SimSun"><span LANG="zh-CN">ﾝ</span></font>,
and the third says &#226;€œPrint Name in &lt;h3&gt;&#226;€<font FACE="SimSun"><span LANG="zh-CN">ﾝ
</span></font>(you don&#226;€™t need to include the quotes).
Depending on which button the user clicks, use a document.write
statement to output your name (or any string you like) in the chosen
heading (&lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; as appropriate).&#160;
Also. As we practiced in class, you will want each button to connect
to its own function.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sometimes in programming, we have to
look at code that is unfamiliar and figure out how to work with it.&#160;
This problem asks you to do that in a fairly basic way. Here is a
line of code that determines the square root of 10:&#160;
<b>Math.sqrt(10)</b>&#160;&#160;&#160; Create a page that has three
buttons, one says: <i>Square Root of 10</i> that will display an
alert box showing the squre root of 10. There Math class also gives
you a power function that returns an exponent so that, for example,
<b>Math.pow(2,3)</b>&#160; returns 2<sup>3</sup> (i.e. 8).&#160; Have
a button that says&#160; <i>2</i> <i>Cubed</i>&#160; that will output
that result.&#160; For the third button, go to W3Schools and look up
the &#226;€˜Math&#226;€™ object in the Javascript section. Choose any
function you like as your 3<sup>rd</sup> function to demonstrate. Use
&#226;€˜alert&#226;€™ boxes to demonstrate the output of these
functions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>3.&#160; Create a single form to add people to your pizza
company&#226;€™s mailing list. (The pizza company you created
previously). Include fields for first name, last name, email address,
and phone number on the form. Have a radio button with options for
&#226;€˜yes&#226;€™ and &#226;€˜no&#226;€™ in which you ask the user if
they would like to be added to your company&#226;€™s mailing list for
periodic specials, etc.&#160;&#160; When the user submits the form,
output an alert box thanking them for submitting their information.
This page should have Div sections for the header and main content</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><b>Submission:</b></p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>Also be SURE to include the URLs to all three pages on&#160;
D2L .
