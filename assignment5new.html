<p><b>Assignment #5</b></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As always, I can not emphasize enough the importance of reviewing
the material and practicing the concepts BEFORE attempting the
homework. If you do so, you will see that the assignment is not all
that difficult. If, however, you try to begin the assignment with no
or very little practice and review, you may get through it, but it
will take you longer, you will make more mistakes, and you will not
understand the material as well. Just my $0.02&#226;€&#166;.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For this question, you will write a
currency converter. You will have a text field where you ask the user
to enter a quantity in U.S. Dollars.&#160; Then have 3 buttons, one
says: &#226;€˜Convert to Euros&#226;€™, another that says &#226;€˜Convert
to British Pounds&#226;€™ and a third that says &#226;€˜Convert to
Mexican Pesos&#226;€™.&#160; When the user clicks the button, a
function should be invoked that outputs the resulting conversion
using a document.write statement.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;">a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Use the
following conversions:&#160; 1 USD = 0.76 Euros, 0.62 British pounds,
13.23 Mexican Pesos</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;">b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Have some kind
of heading section that says:&#160; &#226;€œCurrency Converter&#226;€<font FACE="SimSun"><span LANG="zh-CN">ﾝ
</span></font>or something similar. Have some kind of image there as
well such as a picture of currency symbols, etc.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;">c.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Have two
div sections &#226;€“ one for the header section, and another for the
main section. 
</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;">d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Your
document.write statement should be in a complete sentence like this:&#160;
<font FACE="Courier New"><font SIZE="2">For $150 US Dollars, you will
get 114 Euros.</font></font>&#160; 
</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;">e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Be sure
to create a variable to store the US currency and have a second
variable to store the foreign currency. Feel free to create other
variables as needed, but you should not need to for this assignment.</p>
<p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Use the code from your pizza ordering
page from assignment #4.&#160;   When the user submits the form,
output a confirmation using innerHTML. The confirmation should thank
the user and confirm all the text field info that they entered (Not
pizza size or toppings). It will be a fairly long output statement
(lots of plus signs!), so you will probably want to turn word-wrap on
within your text editor.&#160; So your output might look something
like this:&#160; <font FACE="Courier New">Thank you Bob Smith! We
have your address as 123 Memory Lane, your phone number is
847-333-4444. </font>
</p>
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1in;"><font FACE="Calibri">a.</font><font FACE="Calibri">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font><font FACE="Calibri">Again, have at least two div sections,
one for the header and second div section for your main content such
as the form. </font>
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><b>Submission:</b></p>
<p><font FACE="Symbol">&#183;</font><font FACE="Symbol">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</font>&#160;Be SURE to include the URLs to all web pages on the D2L
server.
